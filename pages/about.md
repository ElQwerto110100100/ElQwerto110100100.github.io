G'day, my name is Joshua 'ElQwerto' Hoban. I am a software engineering student with a passion for cyber security and other fields of engineering such as electrical and mechanical engineering.

Out side of uni I will be working away on my software/electronics projects, reading articles and academic papers on cyber security, participate in CTFs or creating my next artwork and learning my next languages.
